# Scenario:

Company XYZ held a promo sale for their signature items named: x,y,z. Sales are at an
all-time high, but they want to create a marketing strategy to target age groups of people by
looking at total quantities purchased.
They then created a database with these business rules:

• A sales receipt can have multiple items in an order.
• For every order, the clerk records all quantities for all items, including items not
bought (which they denote with quantity=NULL).
• Each customer can do multiple sales transactions, and has his/her age stored in a
database
